# Meeting Notes

## 18.04.2023 First Group Meeting
- Scheduled our regular meeting for Thursdays after class
- Luis found subreddits where only bots have created (a lot, a lot, a lot of) comments --> this could be used for a bot detection algorithm
- Yvonne is interested in trying clustering
- We won't meet this week anymore
- Modelling exploration till next Thursday (27.04.2023) --> decision about what we want to focus on and sending mail to Prof. Ehmke
- Discussion how we want to use GitHub and how to structure our files

<br/>

## 18.04.2023 Kick Off Meeting with Project Supervisor
- We can always ask for a feedback meeting if needed
- It is fine if we want to build a sentiment score even though there is one existing for comments
- All our ideas make sense 
- We should focus on one and let Prof. Ehmke know about our decision in about a week
- Some of our data preparation ideas would also count as modelling
- We don't need to use all the data, a subset would be fine too
- Prof. Ehmke liked for example the ideas of bot detection, topic clustering, topic developement over time as well as description / sense making of clusters

## 29.04.2023 Meeting after DDS class about focus
Questions so far:
- Which topics are discussed on Reddit regarding climate change?
- How can these topics be described/characterized (e.g. in terms of their emotion, sentiment, most used words, ...)?

Extra:
- How do the topics behave over the years; are there differences? (Focus on specific years/ranges; maybe align with "history" of climate change denial)

We also discussed that:
- Empty posts, bot subreddits, duplicates and the word climate change are sorted out.
- We will use BERTopic for topic clustering.
- We will use comments, post text and post title
- Luis will do some research on Reddit and climate change discourse over time so we have some context for our results; also he will check the socio-ecnomomic background of Reddit users
- Anja takes care of data cleaning and topic clustering
- Felix looks into sentiment, emotion and continues to tinker with his API query which we can then use as an add on.
- Will make an individual, fancier poster
