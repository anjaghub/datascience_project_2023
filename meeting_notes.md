# Meeting Notes

## 18.04.2023 First Group Meeting
- Scheduled our regular meeting for Thursdays after class
- Luis found subreddits where only bots have created (a lot, a lot, a lot of) comments --> this could be used for a bot detection algorithm
- Yvonne is interested in trying clustering
- We won't meet this week anymore
- Modelling exploration till next Thursday (27.04.2023) --> decision about what we want to focus on and sending mail to Prof. Ehmke
- Discussion how we want to use GitHub and how to structure our files

## 18.04.2023 Kick Off Meeting with Project Supervisor
- We can always ask for a feedback meeting if needed
- It is fine if we want to build a sentiment score even though there is one existing for comments
- All our ideas make sense 
- We should focus on one and let Prof. Ehmke know about our decision in about a week
- Some of our data preparation ideas would also count as modelling
- We don't need to use all the data, a subset would be fine too
- Prof. Ehmke liked for example the ideas of bot detection, topic clustering, topic developement over time as well as description / sense making of clusters
