# Meeting Notes

## 27.04.2023 Topic Decision
- Research questions which we want to propose:
    - Which topics are discussed on Reddit in relation to climate change?
    - How can these topics be described (e.g. in terms of their emotion, sentiment, most used words, ...)?
    Extra:
    - How do the topics behave over the years; are there changes over time?

- Empty posts, bot subreddits, duplicates and the word climate change will be sorted out
- We will use BERTopic for topic clustering
- We will use comments, post text and post title to do the analysis
- Luis will do some research on Reddit and climate change discourse over time so we can compare our results with real world knowledge
- Anja takes care of data cleaning and topic clustering
- Felix is looking into sentiment, emotion and playing with his API query which we might be able to use as an add on later
- Next week is the peer review meeting, we'll ask if we want to do it in person or not; in any case, the related questionnaire has to be filled out afterwards
- We don't want to use the "lame" poster template from DataScience department, but we want to give it a shiny update

## 18.04.2023 First Group Meeting
- Scheduled our regular meeting for Thursdays after class
- Luis found subreddits where only bots have created (a lot, a lot, a lot of) comments --> this could be used for a bot detection algorithm
- Yvonne is interested in trying clustering
- We won't meet this week anymore
- Modelling exploration till next Thursday (27.04.2023) --> decision about what we want to focus on and sending mail to Prof. Ehmke
- Discussion how we want to use GitHub and how to structure our files

## 18.04.2023 Kick Off Meeting with Project Supervisor
- We can always ask for a feedback meeting if needed
- It is fine if we want to build a sentiment score even though there is one existing for comments
- All our ideas make sense 
- We should focus on one and let Prof. Ehmke know about our decision in about a week
- Some of our data preparation ideas would also count as modelling
- We don't need to use all the data, a subset would be fine too
- Prof. Ehmke liked for example the ideas of bot detection, topic clustering, topic developement over time as well as description / sense making of clusters
