# A brief history of climate change deception

<br/>

1990s: In the early 1990s, many fossil fuel companies, including ExxonMobil, began to fund organizations that questioned the scientific consensus on climate change. These organizations, such as the Global Climate Coalition and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, claimed that the scientific evidence for climate change was inconclusive or overstated. They also argued that any proposed policies to address climate change would be too costly and could harm economic growth.

2000s: In the early 2000s, climate change denial began to gain traction among conservative politicians and media outlets. In 2004, the documentary "The Great Global Warming Swindle" aired on British television, promoting the view that climate change was a natural phenomenon and not caused by human activity. In the same year, the Bush administration withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, the first international agreement to address climate change, arguing that it would harm the US economy.

2010s: In the 2010s, climate change denial became increasingly associated with right-wing politics and the Tea Party movement in the US. Many Republican politicians, including presidential candidate Mitt Romney, began to distance themselves from the scientific consensus on climate change. Meanwhile, the Heartland Institute, a libertarian think tank, began to hold annual conferences promoting climate change denial.

In addition, some fossil fuel companies began to promote the idea of individual responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in 2005, BP launched a campaign encouraging consumers to calculate their "carbon footprint" and make changes to reduce their own emissions. This approach was criticized by many environmental advocates, who argued that it ignored the larger systemic factors that contribute to climate change.

2016-present: In recent years, climate change denial has become less mainstream and less influential, as the scientific consensus on climate change has become more widely accepted. However, some politicians and media outlets continue to question the scientific evidence for climate change and oppose policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, President Donald Trump withdrew the country from the Paris Agreement, the second international agreement to address climate change, in 2017, and his administration rolled back environmental regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Biden administration has since rejoined the Paris Agreement and is pushing for more ambitious climate policies.

Overall, while some fossil fuel companies have started to acknowledge their role in contributing to climate change and have taken steps to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions, many environmental advocates argue that more systemic changes, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources and implementing government regulations, are necessary to address the issue.
